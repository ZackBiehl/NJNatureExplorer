This is a website about the Ecosystem of New Jersey

You can click on any county on the map and it will take you into an in depth look at the local ecosystem of said county.

You can scroll or click the hyper link to learn about the wildlife/fauna, flora, and fungi, as well as the habitats they live in!





The Website is pretty intuitive as it tells you what to do, 
but depending on your device and the screen of said device 
can really effect the experience of the website.
This is because I did not know how to make a website responsive when I made this
SO 
I will be focusing on improving this website just a little bit before I let it rest.
Until then enjoy the website!
