                My name is Zack, I'm currently a senior in highschool in Atlantic County. I have been learning to code for awhile being interested in coding video games 
                when I was younger. 
                I started with coding simple videogames in Unity Engine us C# 
                which is the first coding language I learned pretty well. In highschool I took Computer Science Honors in my sophomore year where I learned JavaScript, and the next year, my junior year,
                I took AP Computer Science A where I learned Java. Near the end of the year and into the summer I taught myself how to use HTML and CSS, I would use these languages in combination with JS to 
                make small websites in the summer and finally this one! <br> I have always been interesting in nature and found a lot of joy just walking around in the woods and learning about nature when I got interested in something.
                My interest in the enviroment also made me take the AP Enviromental Class which only got me more interested in the topic.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
                Why did I make this website?
            </h2>
            <p class="bold-subheading">I have wanted to make a website ever since the last few months of my AP Computer Science A class where we got to choose what we wanted to work on and I chose web devasting
                <br> I found making a website to be very fun but I didn't know what to make. I have always loved nature, going to a sleepaway summer camp every year since I was 9 years old (excluding 2020) and working their now as a counsler. <br>
                I I also always felt like people didn't give New Jersey enough credit for how cool of a state it is. So I wanted to make a webstie displaying what I think is an underrated state when it comes to it's natural enviroments and ecosystems.
